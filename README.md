# Predict-Loan-Amount
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the loan amount that a borrower is eligible for based on various features such as income, credit score, employment history, and loan term. Predicting loan amounts accurately can assist financial institutions in automating the loan approval process and improving decision-making
## Content
- Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering.
- Regression Imputation: Utilize regression techniques to impute missing values for variables like Income (USD) and Credit Score.
- Model Training: Train machine learning models using algorithms like Linear Regression.
- Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
- Diagnostic Checks: Conduct residual analysis, assess feature importance, and perform cross-validation to ensure model reliability.
